This is a temporary fork of https://github.com/russross/blackfriday with the `v2` branch published under `master` instead.

You should _not_ use this fork and instead use https://github.com/russross/blackfriday directly.

The only reason this fork exists is to easily import v2 of blackfriday in both Go modules _and_ GopherJS non-Go-Modules easily within the [Vecty project](https://github.com/gopherjs/vecty). Once this is fixed (https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/issues/855) this fork will no longer be used.
